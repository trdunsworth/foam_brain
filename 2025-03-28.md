Ellen's not feeling well today. We think that she's gotten food poisoning from Captain D's last night. That sucks.

I have finished my generators. After I get my slide deck done, I think that I will make a post on my blog, if I ever write anything in the bloody thing again. I have to get off my arse and start being more diligent on it. I heard from CompTIA about the DataSys+ and a new JTA. I have signed up for it at the end of July.
