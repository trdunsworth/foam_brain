Took care of the updated stats for Tenesia/Renee at 208 S Whiting. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

The rest of the day is going to be meetings, meetings, and did I mention meetings? I suppose that I only have myself to blame for that. However, it will also make the day go by so much faster. 

I need to create a new TODO list for different things this weekend. Most of it is just bits and bobs.
