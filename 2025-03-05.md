Start with the meeting with Ryon, Andrew, and Karl. I don't share Karl's optimism. I was both right and pleasantly surprised. My first take-away is that I can feel comfortable that Karl hasn't been misreading ITS resistance to DECC's purchasing requests. That came through loud and clear.  I expected the approach of "You guys have been doing this for so long and we need you to do it one more time." However, this has got to be the last time. Neither of us wants to be this involved in the day-to-day of the CAD any longer. I think that Andrew taking a leading role in Michael getting training would be great.

Need to send an email to Tracy Empringham to start the data collection process in Canada.

I had something else on my mind, but it escapes me now. I need to call Bay Transit and to call the library about the AARP tax help.

Need to add pwgen on the Linux box:

```bash
sudo pacman -S pwgen
```
