# Commonwealth Data Project

## Background

On 06 January 2025, I received a text message from a friend and former colleague asking how, hypothetically, someone could view all the open service calls across all the state's PSAPs. I could design such a system and then I decided that this would be a good project to describe and write up as a document. I can put all of my notes here and then write them up as a document later.
