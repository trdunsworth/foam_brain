# StyleGuides

Since NENA doesn't have a style guide and we likely should have one for different code projects on which we work, I've volunteered to help iweth the process. The following is a list of style guides and style guide sites that we can access to examine them and then write one up.

- [Google's Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)
- [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
- [Flathub YAML Style Guide](https://github.com/flathub/flathub/wiki/YAML-Style-Guide)
- [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- [PEP7](https://peps.python.org/pep-0007/)
- [Awesome Guidelines](https://github.com/Kristories/awesome-guidelines)
- [How to Create a Style Guide](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/create-a-programming-style-guide/)
