Chaotic morning. Woke up with the headache still. Ellen's on about the bill pay and, in the end, what she really needed, was mostly at her disposal.

Karl asked me to finish off the memory allocation for SQL Server on CAD02 and CAD03. I don't think that will help the issues that we're facing on CAD02 because I think that those have to do with how the Beta was implemented, not the resources available. Finished off the CALEA report for 1Q2025. 

Good discussion with Andrew about High A on SQL Server and whether or not it's needed in our environment. He wants to see me get some training on Rubrik so I can help with the SQL Servers I control and be able to take care of my own backups/restores/etc. Nik doesn't want to impact their paid training, so we'll find a compromise.
