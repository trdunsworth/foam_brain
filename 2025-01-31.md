Today's been a day. I got the stuff for FCFD and the C2C project completed. It wasn't that difficult, so I'm happy about that. 

Destiny decided that she was going to pop off because I wouldn't do what she told me to do. Personally, I'm done with that headache. I will work with her, but she's crossed too many lines for me. I have put that into Walt's hands and I'm not going to do anything else about it.
