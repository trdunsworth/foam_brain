CAD Down called 2212 Hours. Destiny has logged in and started restarting the environment. According to Andrew Cutting, Wheeler lost connection to the Comcast Head End at 2201 and was restored at 2207. Apparently, that was on the Comcast side. Everything is back up and running properly. Destiny was present and took care of everything, only asking me to check CAD01 behind her to ensure everything was working properly.
