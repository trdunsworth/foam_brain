Finished the weekly reports. Gabi is satisfied with her report as I've built it.

Working with Destiny to ascertain the root cause of an error between our GovWorx QA software and the CAD. GovWorx has asserted that the issue is within the ALX firewall. However, I can't see anything in the log files that substantiates that assertion. She is going to try to get them back into a meeting after one of my NENA meetings. If she can do that, I will attend.

ISDWG - Working on the definition of an artefact. The consensus is to retain the NENA definition as how things are attached to documents. Now, we're discussing how to work around the idea of squashing commits. Now how do we handle GitHub issues? That is a great question because we know that developers are not always going to be parts of a working group, but may still be develop against the standards.

Good meeting with Tim Adkins from FCFD regarding some data information that they want. I will start on that tomorrow. I think that I can generalize it from the discussion and from what he's sent in chat. I can use CAD data by focusing on unit acknowledgement then using that to build stuff out.

Good conversation with Lawence. He's got me thinking about leveraging the Logger function in the IDX to perhaps do some of what he's discussing at a general level.
