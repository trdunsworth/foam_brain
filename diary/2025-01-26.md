Made a pretty blue background for this account on the Chromebook with a Buddha statue below a Torii gate. It looks really nice. I've been hearing a lot from Tabarek today. I agree with Ellen that she seems to want to feign helplessness to get others to step up and take care of things for her and the suicidal ideations are concerning, but potentially an act.
