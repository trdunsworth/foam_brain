Today is the first and bulk of the CIF on AI. I don't have to speak today, so today I get to listen to others and learn more than speak. That doesn't mean that I am not busy in the side conversations. I have had some great conversations with MCP, Hexagon, and NCT911. I am already hearing about EAS for this year and hearing that I was missed by folks last year. I'm flattered.

I have been invited to participate in another working group that has a slightly different, but related focus. I've also been invited  to sit down with Hexagon's dev team to discuss data in 911. I'm honoured by the request.

Prepared's presentation on "What is AI?" was well-done.

I want to update my blog to cover what I have presented on here and what I've learned. I've downloaded the files here so I can work on my Chromebook and work on the Dr. D account.

Great example of how AI can manipulate reality. - Got 7 out of the 10 real vs AI. Still feel good about it, but that's not good enough for use in a centre.
