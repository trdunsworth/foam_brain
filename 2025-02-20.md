## Work Notes

The merry-go-round with Destiny has started again. She awakened me at 0445 this morning with 9 Teams messages about something that was "for when you got up." When, after the start of business hours, I followed up with clarifications, she acts like she doesn't understand why I need to clarify anything. Instead, I get another round of pictures and as half-arsed explanaiton. I asked for a 1:1 list of name and machine to ensure that I accomplish what she's asking.

On top of that, they are having issues with admin accounts and getting machines read at Mill Rd. Not my problem. Not Karl's either. Walt seems to be doing the "handle it, handle it" routine from Carter Country years ago.

She finally has accepted that I will need the list of names to the machine.

Spoke to Walt. He said that he's spoken to Destiny and that she will agree not send Teams messages after hours for non-emegencies. The whole call felt like I was being placated.

I finally got the list, with notes, from Destiny and discovered that she has no idea what she's talking about. She thinks that there is some mystical *OS/Machine* table in a database somewhere that enables all of the programs on a machine. I can add them to the Machine_Info table, but that has nothing to do with the overall situation at Mill Rd. I have advised Curtis about the situation. He understands the CAD architecture better than she does and he's afraid of the damn thing.

TODO List:

-[X] Get the asset tags in the Machine_Info table when I have the definitive list.
-[X] i3 architecture meeting.
-[X] Finish laundry.
-[X] Put away dishes.
-[ ] Clean off the sidewalk and back steps.
-[X] NG-PSAP meeting, taking notes.
-[ ] Make progress on the negative time project.

### Card of the Day

**Page of Swords** - *Anatolia - Arabic Fairy Tale* Representing youth, charm, and a cunning wit. Well, I think my wit can still be cunning, but I'm hoping that I'm not seeing the reverse of the card today. That would be sullenness, being all talk, and elderly.

*What new opportunities are available to me?*

*Who is an advisor to whom I can listen?*

*What brings me joy right now?* That one is easy. I enjoy the work that I've been doing, however tedious at times, in this project with Tenesia.

## Personal Notes

Install the 'Foggy Minimal Theme' in VS Code later this evening. Really nice and soft on the eyes. I would like to get the vsix file for Positron as well.
