## Personal Notes

Yesterday, I was able to get a new Linux laptop. I'm glad that Ellen was reading reviews of the place here in Tappahannock because he was too expensive. She suggested Craigslist and viola, I found a HP laptop with 24GB of RAM and 1 TB SSD. All for $180. Great deal and we went and got it. So I finished the day working it out.
