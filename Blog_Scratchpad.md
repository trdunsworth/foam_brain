## Synthetic Data Post

When I started working on my presentations discussing the application of statistical analyses in 9-1-1 centres, I made a conscious decision to use synthetic data for the presentations. There were several concerns that led me to that decision. The first is using any centre's data requires them signing a data use agreement and being willing to have their calls and their stats discussed publicly. While I am certain there are centres that would agree to that, it's a challenge over time. There are also issues with ensuring that you retain access and approval to use the data you've already collected as well.

Another challenge that concerns me is recognition. I don't want a distraction because someone recognizes a call and remarks that they or someone they know was involved in the call. this could lead to side discussions aobut how the call was handled. It's far easier to keep everyone focused when there is no chance that any of the data is real or could be known to the participants. Granted, you could create and use datasets that are regional so in California, you grab data from Florida, etc. However, with a national audience, you're always at risk.

Another option is to use [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov) as a data source. However, that relies on the same issues as above, with the sole exception that I don't need a data use agreement out of the gate. However, I have to look through each curated dataset there to find which ones contain the type of data that I want to use in my presentations. Not every jurisdiction will share the same information. Many of the same arguments above still apply here also.

### Drawbacks to Synthetic Data

This doesn't mean that synthetic data is perfect or doesn't present any issues of its own. Recently, I gave a presentation at [Randolph Macon College](https://www.rmc.edu/) discussing what a centre's data can tell them. While the presentation was very successful, I saw things in the dataset that I know need to improve. For example, if you look at this graph, you can see that this dataset has a really busy early morning. The busiest hour over the course of this "center's" year was ***0300***. I would be amazed if I ever found that in real life anywhere.
