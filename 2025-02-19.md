The work laptop upgraded to 24H2 overnight which has broken its ability to connect to the City. While that sucks, I have been able to get to work on other things around the house. That's a benefit.

So while VS Code isn't working on my personal machine, Cursor is working nice, so I'm transferring everything here for now. i will uninstall VS Code and possibly install Codium and see what I can do with that.

Felt like I had a good session wiht Dr. K. today. I like the fact that he pushed me to understand the primal scream was was fraught with emotional reasoning and needed to be watched carefully.
