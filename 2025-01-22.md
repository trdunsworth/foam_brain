Need to get back into practice with this again. I took too much time off while I was in Florida.

I want to create a new TODO list and get it in practice. One of them being creating a mood log template. Then I can use it in here when I have my bad days. 

Received a data request from Destiny today. The request is interesting and has the potential for a lot of detail. I have questions and she seems to be uncomfortable with answering them. She needs to be trained to understand that any request for data isn't always as straightforward as it seems. That's why I play 20 questions for each request.

The request appears to only need a couple of tables which will be nice.
