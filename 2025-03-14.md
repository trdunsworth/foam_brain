## Work Notes

So far, everything is quiet. I have taken care of several things this morning and I have one more on the plate before the meetings hit. Destiny wanted to kow if I was available for PowerPhone to take care of my CAD workstation. I told her that I am if need be, but she can have the machine and do it without me.  I need to look into stuff for Ryon with the re-host. I had hoped that Karl was going to spend some time looking at it with me, but that hasn't happened, so here we are. 

For as much as I rag on Destiny about trying to hook me into things that I don't need to be part of, I have to admit that she's right in approaching me to update things on ADM12 before PowerPhone gets involved in it. That way, if something goes awry, I don't come back and blame her.

## Personal Notes

I got my Toastmasters stuff done before Monday's meeting. I do need to finish writing the speech this weekend, or at least taking better notes. I am headed back to lodge for the first time in a few years. That's going to be different, but it may be welcome all the same.
