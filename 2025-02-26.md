Let's see what today brings shall we? I know that my attitude is going to define how my day goes.

The day has started pretty quietly. I've been able to get laundry done. I've written a letter to the governor about ensuring access to contraception for all state citizens and to ensure that our medical records remain private and beyond the reach of the federal government.

I've heard from Gabi asking me to do a FOIA search. *No resutls were obtained.*

*Touch wood* Destiny has remained quiet. I guess she thinks she won something by working on projects that should have stayed with me today.

I'm creating a new update for Tenesia and Gabi. I will get that sent out when I leave for the day, which is soon.
