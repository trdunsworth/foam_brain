It's been a while since I've worked in here. I caught up my weekly reports yesterday and I need to do the monthly reports today. 

Had a CAD crash overnight, but I wasn't involved and wasn't invited to the party. That's fine with me. 

Completed the monthly reports and I think I've addressed what Tiana wanted as well. Getting the batteries for the mower charged up so they can be used later today. 

Got the SO data request taken care of for now. I was able to leverage an older query that I had done for Gabi and Mike Rezak and get them started. I don't know if this is exactly what they want, but it's a good start until they figure stuff out. 

Got a request from APD wanting all call data for the last 6 months. I'm working with them to narrow the scope a little bit. That's not just a tonne of data, it's a lot of information without a context.
