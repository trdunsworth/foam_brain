## Notes

I had a couple of interesting dreams today and I wrote them down in my paper journal. I think that they have to do with changes in mt life and the things that I want to do in my life. 

I will create better notes tomorrow.

### Card of the Day

***Four of Swords*** *Fenrir - Norway/Asatru*
This is a card of taking respite before the next battle. I think that my next battle will be personal and I think this quiet period is the respite I need before taking up the big battle.
