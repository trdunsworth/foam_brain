## Notes

Working out some of the notes that I have with working on Linux expertise. I can write up stuff for the blog.

The Linux information gathering was great for sitting through a meeting that I really didn't need to be at. I wanted to be there to demonstrate to Walt that I do know my role as a senior member of staff.

Taking notes today for EIDO JSON as usual.
