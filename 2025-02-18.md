## Work Notes

Started with a phone call from the floor. Destiny couldn't be located and WestNet was failing. Karl fixed that and then, together, we troubleshot the PowerPhone issues.

Got a Teams message from Destiny this morning asking me to look over two stations to figure out why, when she copied dlls over to the machines, they still don't work. I'm not a bloody dll whisperer.

Now, it's are you sure that everything between the production and reporting databases is working properly? Why, yes, yes it is working properly. Between 0 and 4 seconds. Well within prescribed parameters.

1215 hours: Email from the floor stating that they cannot run anything through VCIN unless they are using the VCIN dedicated terminal. The interface is not showing any issues. TCS is able to run queries and I'm seeing them populate through the interface. Got a really nice letter from Tiana. I've forwarded it to Curtis so he can put it in my file for anything in the future from Walt about teamwork.
