It's been Monday. I have my speech tonight and Tiffany is going to assign my distractors. I hope they are fairly quick, then I get them out of the way by acknowledging them in some fashion.

I have some ideas on how to re-arrange things with my laptop and future research. Need to get the blog post out too.
