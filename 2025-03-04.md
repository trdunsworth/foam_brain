Quiet start to the morning. First off, there was an invitation from CS to attend a meeting about DR. This is one of the few, lately, that I think is worth attending and pay attention. Working on everything for CallProc. There is an official ask as to what to collect, so I provided the why as well.

Got the newest batch of welcome letters out today and decided to narrow everything to either Tuesday or Wednesday and put it on Higher Logic as well.

It looks like I will be on a call with Karl to help Michael and Destiny understand what the hell we taught them to do.

So now, I might be able to get access to Canadian data to augment the US data we're hoping to collect for the Call Processing WG analysis of the NFPA call standards that NENA adopted.

Have a meeting scheduled with Ryon, Andrew, and Karl tomorrow to discuss the issues between DECC and ITS currently.
