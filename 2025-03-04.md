Quiet start to the morning. First off, there was an invitation from CS to attend a meeting about DR. This is one of the few, lately, that I think is worth attending and pay attention. Working on everything for CallProc. There is an official ask as to what to collect, so I provided the why as well.

Got the newest batch of welcome letters out today and decided to narrow everything to either Tuesday or Wednesday and put it on Higher Logic as well.

It looks like I will be on a call with Karl to help Michael and Destiny understand what the hell we taught them to do.

So now, I might be able to get access to Canadian data to augment the US data we're hoping to collect for the Call Processing WG analysis of the NFPA call standards that NENA adopted.

Have a meeting scheduled with Ryon, Andrew, and Karl tomorrow to discuss the issues between DECC and ITS currently. Karl discovered that 6 of the 20 workstations on the floor at Wheeler aren't working properly. I wish that I could be surprised. Then again, as much as Karl wasnts to believe that the meting with Ryon is going to be productive, I think it's going to be more of the Kumbaya shyte that we have from Walt. It's going to be manager speak. I just don't have any confidence that he or Vanetta will do anything about it. That sucks feeling like I have no managerial support.
