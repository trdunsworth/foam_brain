## Personal Rant

It hit me this morning that I'm starting to see more posts on BlueSky reposting X posts from people now seeing how the implementation of Trump's policies are hurting the people who elected him. I cannot feel sympathy for those who are being hurt by supporting this idiot and seeing their desire to hurt other people turn on them. If you voted for this and it now harms you, **GOOD!** I really believe that you are getting what you bloody well deserve.

## Work Notes

I received a request from Destiny today that doesn't make bloody sense, as usual. She's asking me to go over nearly 25,000 calls to find *"unusual fire-related calls"* and to *"double-check any calls that donâ€™t seem to have been completed properly"*. I have no clue what that means. She also admits that she knows this is likely GIS related, but somehow I am supposed to be a mind reader. This is ridiculous.
