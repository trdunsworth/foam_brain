## Work Notes

Received a note last night from the floor that C2C might be off line. Seems to be a pattern when Destiny is out of the office that something seems to have an issue. This morning, the floor reported that they wanted the CAD machines to have the printers pointed to Wheeler. That makes sense.

Signing in to Zoom early so I can get the 2FA code from Sandy. So that's been taken care of.

## Personal Notes

Cancelled the last of SiriusXM. We thought that we'd cancelled it back in 2023, but here we are.

Testing to see if this is going to work and stay stable. I am finding a lot of problems with any VS Code derivative on this Linux box. that's not a comforting thought, but I will make it work. I'm not happy about a few things with this box.
