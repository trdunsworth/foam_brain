## Work Notes

I finally got to the bottom of the Destiny email, Walt's "Kumbaya" email not withstanding, and she's looking for either vSphere or AD and I don't have administrative privileges for either of them. So, I can safely extract myself from this situation and it shows that Destiny really doesn't know what she's talking about, so it focuses on how that exacerbates the situation.

The issue with Windows 24H2 came back. Thankfully, the guys at the Help Desk have created a temporary solution to tide things over until a GPO can be created at address this.

We have a CAD issue that new connections to the CAD are being rejected. CS wants to blame the network and ITS can prove that it was on the CAD side. 

### TODO List

-[ ] Find out from Maryland DMV is there's an active lien on the Bug
~~-[ ] EIDO JSON Meeting (note taking)~~
