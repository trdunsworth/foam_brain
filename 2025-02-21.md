## Work Notes

I finally got to the bottom of the Destiny email, Walt's "Kumbaya" email not withstanding, and she's looking for either vSphere or AD and I don't have administrative privileges for either of them. So, I can safely extract myself from this situation and it shows that Destiny really doesn't know what she's talking about, so it focuses on how that exacerbates the situation.

### TODO List

-[ ] Respond to Destiny email
-[ ] Find out from Maryland DMV is there's an active lien on the Bug
-[ ] EIDO JSON Meeting (note taking)
-[ ] EIDO Conveyance (note taking)
-[ ] Weekly Shopping

### Card of the Day

### Personal Notes

I'm tired at the moment.
