## Notes

Two sets of reports due today. I might delay the monthly reports to tomorrow.

**Call Proc WG:** We're going to publish the final updates for Phase 1 as v1 of the new standard and then submit an ISF and Charter for v2 and make that a new version with the data aggregation and investigation. This will be another working group leader role for me. I'm excited, however, to start working on either validating or invalidating the adoption of the NFPA standard.

### Follow ups from list
