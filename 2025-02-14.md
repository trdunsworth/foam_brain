Yup, it's Valentine's Day. Welcome to the corporate holiday. I shouldn't be so cynincal because I am happy that I'm married to Ellen. It's funny watching '__Un Professore__' and thinking about my own relationship with Ellen. I see Dante and think that he can see what's immediately in front of him and he doesn't act in a way that fits his best interests.

## Work notes

I completed my Kronos for the week.
