I want to start with some of Matt Dancho's [open-source work](https://github.com/business-science/ai-data-science-team). Granted, I would prefer to do this in R, but I can convert that over time as I start bringing it around to how I want to create it.

I know that I can do a tonne of this in Python, but I want to keep doing a lot of my work in R where possible and then use [reticulate](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/reticulate-1.pdf).
