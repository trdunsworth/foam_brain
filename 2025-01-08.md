Weather is better today, so the City is open. I'm still working with Curtis' instructions not to worry about coming up to the city this week.
Yesterday's commit didn't work as expected. I'm not happy about that. I need to add notes today concerning events from yesterday. That part doesn't bother me nearly as much as the commit failure. There's a lot to document. There will be a lot of it in my paper journal as well.

I'm about to uninstall whatever extension in VS Code is doing the AI prediction like it's my cell phone or something. I want to control what I write and not have to keep correcting it when I am writing.

I had an interesting thought this morning while I was in the shower. We have all of these different methods to measure forecasting accuracy. How do we determine which ones are the best and why are they better than others? I want to collect a few papers to really go over this. [[Forecasting Accuracy Project]] should be some interesting research.

## Work Notes

I think today is going to be a quiet day in the office. I need to work with folks to start getting the decks built for SBP. I will concentrate on that tomorrow because I want to make better progress on the report template for ALX today.

## Personal Notes

I received an updated CV suggestion from a resume writer at NU. That was really impressive. I also had a really interesting *"interview"* with GovWorx. He wants to start with me consulting with them to address a new BI tool they've acquired and develop better reports for it. Sounds like an interesting proposition and he said he would like to "date before getting married"; noting that they want to hire a data scientist in the future. The funny part was that he seemed to be on the back foot throughout much of the discussion. I don't think that he expected what he encountered. I'm not someone easily flattered by the attention, so I keep my head and use my knowledge and skills to stay ahead of the conversation.
