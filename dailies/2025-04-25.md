I'm tired this morning. Got Tenesia's rquests done pretty easily. That wasn't a challenge. NENA has released the public comment version of two GIS standards. I should review them so I can learn more about data science in the GIS realm. I'm going to park a few links in here later. 

I just say that Rob Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos have collaborated with the folks at Nixtla to create a free time series forecasting book for Python. That's worth a read. [Forecasting Principles and Practices Python](https://otexts.com/fpppy/) 

Working with some data points with Tenesia so they can try to add a new shift that would cover the increase in calls during the summer months. Now I get to do some real data science!!!

I will figure out the rest of this and see where we can go from here.
