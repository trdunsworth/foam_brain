## General Notes
I was able to get [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) installed on my Chrome Book, so when I take this anywhere, I can keep the diary format with me. I'm getting much more comfortable with it in the early stages, so it's time to learn how to use it for other things. 
### Personal Notes 
I found a couple of papers that I want to read soon. 
### Card of the Day
