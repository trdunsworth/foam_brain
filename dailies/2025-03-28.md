Ellen's not feeling well today. We think that she's gotten food poisoning from Captain D's last night. That sucks.

I have finished my generators. After I get my slide deck done, I think that I will make a post on my blog, if I ever write anything in the bloody thing again. I have to get off my arse and start being more diligent on it. I heard from CompTIA about the DataSys+ and a new JTA. I have signed up for it at the end of July. 

I have gotten NENA's registration and the lodging paid for. While I don't like paying for it out of pocket myself noww. However, I can't wait for everyone in ALX to figure out how and when to do this. I am looking forward to sitting in on Gabi's session about analytics in 9-1-1. It's nice to see that Jenna and I aren't the only ones taking it on and it makes DECC look good.

Got the van back today. Just about $600. I'm ok with that. Looks like we need to get some fuses for the turn signals and the hazard lights.
