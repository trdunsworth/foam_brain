## Work Notes

Today I have the standard two arguments. I'm guessing that I will have a new Destiny "crisis" arise that she wants to use to pull me out of my meetings. Then again, after the meeting with Ryon, I still feel like I'm going to get hung with this rehosting. If I have to be hung with it, I want the authority to give Destiny and Michael instruction and direction as to what to do and then we will all document it together.

The first argument went well.

## Personal Notes

One good thing, one of the weekly Pogo challenges is Canasta. Ellen and I can have a bit of fun in the evenings playing and getting the badges for it. Dad called to let me know that Charlie Holloman had passed. That's a shame to hear. I knew it was coming, but it's none the easier when you do hear it. At least dad has stopped panicking about his email. I don't know what was in there and I don't want to know. I also got the Richard update. Apparently, he hasn't gone to D.C. for his birthday yet. He's an adult and if he gets into trouble and messages me, I will assess the situation, but I don't think he will, even if he gets into a jam.

That's kind of interesting.)

According to the deck guide, the questions to be answered are:

- What strengths do my emotions provide?
- What feelings am I keeping submerged?
- How can I channel my emotions to my advantage?
- Am I being overly protective?
- Who is my protector?

Got a new fire built and that has taken off nicely.
