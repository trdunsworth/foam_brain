Typical day in paradise *</sarcasm>* 

Got the reports done for the week. Karl just figured out that we will need at least 3 SQL Server instances for Always On. I had told him that much earlier, but CS was only counting on two. In my opinion that's what happens when you don't know what it is and how it works.
