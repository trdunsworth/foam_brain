Back in the saddle after the NENA convention last week. I realise that I should have used this with the Chromebook to take better notes about everything along the way. That might have been great for retaining artefacts from the experience.

Now, I'm catching up on everything. I finished both weeks of outstanding reports. I've also caught up on Roy's expungement requests and updated the drone dataset. I want to spend some time working on the Python.NET hooks. It looks like only python 3.8 and I have to target .NET 4.8 for CentralSquare.
