The last day of March. The first quarter of the year has flown by and I still feel like I'm in mid-February. I have a presentation in two days and I still don't know exactly what to do about it, but I'm getting there. I mean, it is tacos for dinner Wednesday night, so that's all good. My hip is frelling kidding me which is a big problem.

## Work Notes

I've been working on the reports. I have a meeting with Karl and Rave in a bit. I'm hoping that we can get that taken care of with this visit. I've gotten NENA national registration, housing, and the travel from ABQ to LAX taken care of. I hate having to do it myself, but between DECC and ITS, it's bloody well hopeless.

So, the Rave meeting went well. There is a heartbeat and we have changed the warning to 4 days. It's a little too sensitive.

## Personal Notes

I've updated the work machine for processing on the synthgen software. I found a tutorial site to start withL [Real Python tkinter Tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/). I want to see if Packt has anything in the archives too. It looks like I will need to install TCL/TK from [here](https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/)

Got the apple trees planted and got some of the tulips in.  I'm happy about that, as is Ellen

This stuff with my hip is driving me nuts.
