Started early with Karl conversations about Always On. I understand his enthusiasm for building a cluster like this. I want to use it too. I don't believe that CS has successfully decoupled the application from the data configuration. 

I've updated my call generator by adding the problem column in and now being able to generate those in concert with the agency type. I created my own faker dynaic providers to do that. I am rather impressed with the output. I'v eadded a few other things to it, such as changing the call ID field to look less like a 64-bit UUID, which I didn't mind, and replacing it with a call ID field that looks more like what you'd find in a centre. I've also, now, built an address list so I can get repeated addresses throughout the dataset.

Reading the details from M$, we need to use Failover Cluster Instances to protect the server OS and the databases not just the databases. I read that you can combine FCIs with availability groups for double protection. I really want to use that type of protection, especially knowing who else, other than Karl and I, will be poking in the system.
