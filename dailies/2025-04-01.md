## Work Notes

Need to meet with Andrew and Karl this morning. Walt's email from yesterday reads like he's expecting Karl and I to step in and take care of things that his CAD manager should be handling. I don't want to get back into running the CAD. I've updated the IP inventory for DEC and uploaded it to the Sharepoint site. If they can't figure this stuff out by now, I can't help them.

I finished the Ryon email and also taken care of the CALEA stats for the Watch Officers. 

## Personal Notes

Got the slide deck for tomorrow finished. I think that I will do fine with this presentation. I like what I'm doing with this.
