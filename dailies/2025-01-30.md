Work: Didn't go into the City today due to the air collision last night. Way too much going on that I don't want to travel near.

Work: Destiny finally revealed why she's so insistent about knowing when I'm coming into the City. She was wanting to pawn PowerPhone installations off on to me. I am following Curtis' guidance that I respond to *emergency* situations. Apparently, she's out next week for previously undisclosed training. Now, she's advised that she's going to be out for the next two weeks for different things. I'm guessing that Walt is expecting that I will take care of all of her tasks in the meantime so she doesn't have anything to do when she comes back.

Personal: I had a couple of weird dreams overnight. In the first, I was driving north on 17 in Tappahannock and the lumber yard was moved next to Hoskin's Creek. A woman wearing a greenish-teal jump suit was walking down the street carring a martini. I've seen her before and whenever I see her, something odd is about to happen. So, here we go. The second dream was in my grandparents' house in Coffeyville. I needed to leave and still had some packing to do. I was moving to sleep on the couch in the front room because my grandfather was going to be moved into the bedroom where I was sleeping on the couch. That's a little different.

Personal: Out of the blue, I heard from Shavon on LinkedIn. That's interesting.
