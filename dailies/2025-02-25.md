## Personal Rant

It hit me this morning that I'm starting to see more posts on BlueSky reposting X posts from people now seeing how the implementation of Trump's policies are hurting the people who elected him. I cannot feel sympathy for those who are being hurt by supporting this idiot and seeing their desire to hurt other people turn on them. If you voted for this and it now harms you, **GOOD!** I really believe that you are getting what you bloody well deserve.

## Work Notes

I received a request from Destiny today that doesn't make bloody sense, as usual. She's asking me to go over nearly 25,000 calls to find *"unusual fire-related calls"* and to *"double-check any calls that donâ€™t seem to have been completed properly"*. I have no clue what that means. She also admits that she knows this is likely GIS related, but somehow I am supposed to be a mind reader. This is ridiculous.

I did find out what she wanted later and I was able to get that to her. She was looking for a list of calls that don't have response plans. The database search only turned up test calls and calls that do not have a problem type because they were cancelled prior to being assigned a problem type.

I received an email about a backup failure. Hadn't seen it before. She put in the ticket with CS. I asked her to lealve it for me after she created the ticket with them and she declined. She handled it with Anna. They discovered that deleting the old backup and running a new one solved the issue. First thing that I would have done this morning. It seems interesting that this was discovered on the heels of my recommendation to Esmond that the floor be relocated to Mill Rd. during the Comcast maintenance period to ensure that impacts will be minimal during that window. It gives the appearance that she's looking for something because she's mad that I reached out to Esmond privately.
