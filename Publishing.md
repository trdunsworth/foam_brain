# Publishing

## Background

I have been interested in learning how to ensure that my written work is presented properly. I was not happy with how my dissertation turned out when I used either WordPerfect or Microsoft Word. However, the university did not have a LaTeX template and I learned about other options way too late. However, I've always been fascinated by typesetting and printing. I can't tell you where it came from other than a love of books. I should have looked at starting with that bookbinder in L.A. when I lived out there. I might have learned a thing or two.
