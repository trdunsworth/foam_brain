I have too many ideas at times. I just had another one and I will figure out how to work it out. I feel like I'm shooting in the dark with some things. I will make more sense of them as I go along. I'm stepping away from the EIDO IDX FAQ group. I thought for a while that I was stretching too thin and I'm seeing Sandy agree with me on that. I don't believe that it's a bad thing to step away. I can't be the uber-volunteer and be effective at what I do best.

## Work Notes

Destiny is out again. She's out more than she's in. If there is something else going on with it, we should have some awareness so we can be good support. The look isn't flattering for her at the moment. Karl is still working on his slide deck. I think that it makes sesne. He wants my help with it. I can add in notes and content as he wishes. I think that will work well.

## Project Notes

I have to start being more diligent about knocking things out. The NENA presentation with Jenna will be a good project to start focusing on the educational aspect of what I want to do.
