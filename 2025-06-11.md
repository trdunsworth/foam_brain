## Office Notes

Came into the office today. Meeting with Ryon later to discuss several things. Waiting to hear back from Packt about being interviewed by them. That could be a really nice opportunit y for me down the road. I went ahead and volunteered for the KPI working group in APCO. I know that it is extra work, but it is also important data-driven work to which I can contribute.

Going through some of the sites that I found last night. Some of them I want to deploy on the home lab as well. However, I will work with what I have here first.
