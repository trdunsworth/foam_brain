## Work Notes

Busy day today. I have the regular stats to do, plus I want to get the agenda out for the Staffing group today. Then Roy has sent me a new list of expungements. That won't take long, so I'm not stressed. Just feels like there's a lot to do today. Part of that is likely that I'm thinking ahead to everything else that needs to be done and not stopping to focus on what's in front of me. Strange when I look forward to meetings like Interface Specfiications because I can listen in and get work done because I don't have to lead the meeting, take notes, or be a central participant.

The Interface Spec working group turned out to be more interesting that I expected. It looks like I'm going to end up helping develop a style guide for NENA. I don't mind the work. I think that Word templates are just not working for NENA in general.

Sat in on a meeting with Destiny and Humberto from CS. I really didn't need to be there, but at least Destiny can shut up about my involvement in the CAD.

I'm going to put the style guide links in [[StyleGuides]] for the moment so I can refer to them when I'm working on thing in the future.

## Personal Notes

Caught up on laundry. I also got a new Fedora distro burned and ready for installation later this evening. Completed the loan application for Baylands to get the cars fixed. That will be helpful.
