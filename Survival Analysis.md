# Survival Analysis

## Background

I believe that applying time-to-event or survival analysis to 9-1-1 call data can be useful in determining where improvements may need to be made to ensure the centre is achieving their SLAs with the groups for which they dispatch. I'm going to start collecting links and documents to help me learn more about it and how to apply that to this data. I will also get some links together to teach myself how to apply survival analytics in both R and Python. Granted, I will default to R first because it is my more comfortable language, but that's ok.

This is a series of 4 documents that I have in the Dr. D account that help with the basics of Survival Analysis.

[Machine Learning for Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04649) appears to be an interesting read to understand how to make better use of the two in a combination.
