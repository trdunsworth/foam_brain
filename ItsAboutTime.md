# It's About Time!

Everything we do in 911 centres appears to revolve around time. We pay attention when things happen. We measure the time it takes for things to happen. All of our software record timestamps and we calculate the distance between those timestamps. However, how much do we actually learn from our timestamps? 

In the CAD I've worked with for the vast majority of my public safety career, we have many time points throghout the course of a service call.
