## General Notes
I need to start a habit of this being the first thing I do rather than reading news articles and checking my email. This will enable me to have a better idea of what I need to do and where to start getting it done at.

### Work Notes
Got the set up completed for the reports. Fairly quiet weekend. The goal for today, after the weekly reports, as they are, is to get back on track with the daily reports for the CSAs.
I saw a Medium article this morning about trends in AI for 2025 and I started thinking ahead to CIF in a few weeks. There are going to be many many vendors present at this wanting to hawk their wares, touting their AI prowess. I know that I will be inextricably tied to AI because of my data science background, but I also know that I get 25 to 30 papers a week on AI in various places and I read only a handful of them. If this is the case for me, then I know that someone without the background is going to be overwhelmed. What are the concrete promises that you're making and how does your product deliver those at scale in a production environment?
