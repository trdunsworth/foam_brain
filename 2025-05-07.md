## Day Notes

Starting with a intensely busy day today. I have a meeting with Jenna in a few minutes. I have two new query requests. Tenesia's will likely bear fruit because she already has an idea coming in about she's looking for. I think that Sgt. Amp will have a bigger challenge because he's looking for a shotgun blast. The first pass says that I don't have anything in the CAD that might help him. However, I will go back and review by the time he and I meet.

After our meeting, he's looking to track the deputies assigned to the hospital and mental health runs, but he's not got a lot of data from their reports. Because of what we're seeing in CAD, it appears we can build a current workflow and then build a preferred workflow. I've recommended that he speak to the Watch Officers and I will speak with Tenesia later to se if we can create meaningful change that will better enable data collection and investigation.

I have several emails outstanding now with the Call Proocessing WG data collection project. I'm being invited to be the NENA responder to one of the early answers. That feels like a big deal to be honest. So, I can't say that I'm not a big deal any longer.

Destiny dropped a CHECKDB timeout in my lap. She can see, in my status, that I'm in a call. I think that's the perk for her. She wants to create a reaction and I'm not giving her one.  That turned out to be what I expected; not very much of anything at all.

During the staffing meeting, Louisa brought up that we don't have a call processing standard for admin calls. She wanted our group to create it. I deferred and pointed out that this is out of scope to our work and that we'd be potentially duplicating the work of Call Processing, so I referred her there.

### Jenna meeting

Looking at 45-minute meetings at 1400 EDT every 2nd and 4th Wednesdays. That will allow us to focus on a limited charter. Shye will be the other co-chair for this group. Shye is on board with the time change, saying that she certainly wants me at the table when the group is taking up technical topics.

Presentation: Jenna is going to do a brain dump next week. I will do one on the vacation week. then we will start building our slides after that.
