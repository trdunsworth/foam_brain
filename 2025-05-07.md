## Day Notes

Starting with a intensely busy day today. I have a meeting with Jenna in a few minutes. I have two new query requests. Tenesia's will likely bear fruit because she already has an idea coming in about she's looking for. I think that Sgt. Amp will have a bigger challenge because he's looking for a shotgun blast. The first pass says that I don't have anything in the CAD that might help him. However, I will go back and review by the time he and I meet.

I have several emails outstanding now with the Call Proocessing WG data collection project. I'm being invited to be the NENA responder to one of the early answers. That feels like a big deal to be honest. So, I can't say that I'm not a big deal any longer.

Destiny dropped a CHECKDB timeout in my lap. She can see, in my status, that I'm in a call. I think that's the perk for her. She wants to create a reaction and I'm not giving her one. 

### Jenna meeting

Looking at 45-minute meetings at 1400 EDT every 2nd and 4th Wednesdays. That will allow us to focus on a limited charter. Shye will be the other co-chair for this group.

Presentation: Jenna is going to do a brain dump next week. I will do one on the vacation week. then we will start building our slides after that.
