Started with using Foam to see if it will work better because I can store it on GitHub. I'm getting more comfortable with GH these days. 

### Card of the day
**8 of Cups** - Moses from the Hebrew Mythos.
I'm noticing that it's a dark card. He's walking away from a building into the dunes of the desert. It's a waning moon which shows a weakening. However, the guide book describes it as a lunar eclipse. There's discussion of endings and beginnings. I think that, by deciding to make my refurbishment a gift to Ellen (and really myself), I am trying to end the recent turn of my life. The book also posits the desert as a place of spiritual retreat. That makes sense with Moses and the desert fathers of early Christian traditions. I am returning to reviewing Thomas Moore's and James Hillman's works. I misinterpreted those works decades ago when I first encountered them. I wasn't wise enough to understand them then. I don't know if I've grown as wise as I should have, but I do know that I understand things better now. While I'm also reading Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, I don't want to use the word _grok_ right now. I think that I don't have the complete understanding that word implies.

*What do I feel dissatisfied with?* **ME**
*When is it better to repair and when is it better to leave?* I think that I have to try repair before throwing in the towel and saying that I'm the problem and I can't be fixed. That's not useful. 
*Do I need to change my priorities?* My intention it to do that as I'm moving forward.
*How can I reignite my passions?* I think that I can do that by focusing on the fundamentals and doing what I can to the best of my ability. **Focus** being the key word here. 

### To Do List
- [X] Get the laundry done and ready to dry tonight.
- [ ] Get the trash and recycling ready for the dump.
- [X] Help Ellen make potato soup when she gets up from her rest. 
- [X] Pull my card of the day.
- [ ] Install Foam on my other devices so I can sync them to GH and use this wherever and make it really work for me. 
- [ ] Write about the day after work when we are settled.
- [ ] Start drafting the next blog post for my personal site.
- [ ] Determine when I publish that if I'm X-Posting to Medium.
- [ ] Apply to UVA and WMU as an adjunct prof to start seeing if I can get into academia. 

### Work Notes 
I'm going to spend a lot of today with the new reporting templates so I can make progress to share with Gabi and Tenesia first, then expand that outwards as I get more feedback. 
I'm finding ways to shorten some of the work that I need to do to create summary tables in the reports.


### Personal Notes
I want to apply as an adjunct professor at UVA and WMU so I can see if I can transition into being a professor. That's been a childhood dream, so now it's a possibility.
