## Work Notes

Meetings today. I did getsome good feedback from Gabi about the preliminary analysis that I've completed on the time-to-event data in call handling. I think that this is a very valuable line of inquiry. I just need to teach myself survival analysis from scratch. That's not *that* hard is it?  ðŸ˜†

I tried to get everything set up for the Staffing Guidelines WG. Will need to come up with a new date and time for the meetings.
