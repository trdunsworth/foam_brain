Today was a quiet day after the screaming cats got me up. I did more work on the Camry today. It hasn't made any difference. Ellen has ordered a MAP sensor and it's supposed to be here tomorrow and I will get it installed.

I have to get a lot of things together and get more things done this week. I want to take advantage of the good weather. 

### Blog Post

I ran across [this post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-harris-otcc_what-separates-a-good-analyst-from-a-bad-activity-7297604602240151552-gmGV?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&rcm=ACoAAAC2YgYBrvhfNxWSWZbjnmxdyUtJDtfE5NY) disucssing the differences between a good data analyst and a bad one. Everyone I know wants to be good at their profession, myselef included. The LinkedIn post confirmed to me that I am good at what I do. Here's my confirming example. I'm wokring on a project in the day job analysing the impact of negative times-to-event in CAD systems. First off, they shouldn't exist. We have an order of how calls proceed from start to finish. If the order is out of place, it's likely because a service call has been reopened for some reason.
