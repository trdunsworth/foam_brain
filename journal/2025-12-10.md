## CAD Environment Reset

So, here we are. Awake at 0302 hours waiting for the CAD manager to get started on the process. She did not acknolwedge me for about half an hour after she started. 

Neither Westnet nor Starlight responded well after the reboot. The VCIN errors appear to be unrelated based on timestamps.
