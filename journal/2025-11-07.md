## GovWorx

Meet with Billy to figure out an API call that will enable Eventide data to go into GovWorx.

It's been a while since I've written a pipeline, so I expect that there may be some fitful stops and starts.

Since the Eventide implementation is so old that we can carry on as normal and then we can create the other *by the book* solution later and have it ready to roll when the Eventide implementation is upgraded in the near future.

## Staffing Guidelines Meeting

We're all agreeing that Bill presents a significant problem. We need to get the survey together and have it locked down for presentation at SBP.

Need to ensure that I put up a reminder at the beginning of the next meeting that AI chat assistants and note takers are not allowed per NENA policy.

## Reporting Work

I reordered parts of the EDA work so it made better sense and I have added the counts into the heat map to make it more useful. I've removed the ridge-line plot because even I am not feeling it to be very useful.
