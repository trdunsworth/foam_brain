## Link Farming

There are a lot of links I've identified in the last couple of days that  Iwant to research and use for the future. I am going to document them so I can use them in the future for several projects.

[AI Tutorials with Code](https://github.com/Marktechpost/AI-Tutorial-Codes-Included) I think this could be useful moving forward to work up my skills.
[Run Databases Locally without Admin Rights](https://medium.com/data-science-collective/run-real-databases-locally-without-admin-rights-31042af95df9) - This will come in handy with several projects that I consider.
[Python Libraries replacing Boilerplate LLM Engineering](https://medium.com/data-science-collective/7-python-libraries-that-replaced-all-my-ai-engineering-boilerplate-6d02b66d07d9) I really want to dive into this one. 
[Good GitHub Repos](https://medium.com/write-a-catalyst/these-5-github-repos-taught-me-more-than-any-500-course-9f8d3caa9f91) There are a few interesting ones in here.
[LM Studio Options](https://medium.com/data-science-collective/lm-studio-run-llms-locally-on-your-laptop-in-under-5-minutes-5048b0d6eacb)
[Python for Data Engineering](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/13-modern-python-libraries-and-tools-for-data-engineering-workflows-2910b9ec5215) - Considering I'm working as a Data Engineer.
[Shimmy over Ollama](https://medium.com/@shouke.wei/shimmy-vs-ollama-a-lightweight-alternative-for-local-llm-serving-890caeaf141d) Could this be useful for setting up on a light client.
[Shimmy GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Michael-A-Kuykendall/shimmy)
[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) Karl is talking about using this. Need to get to know it.

Got my first two assignments from them today. Both look to update reporting systems.

Need to work on my dbt and Sisense skills.
