## These Dreams

I've been having some interesting fae-centric dreams of late. They seem to be a pattern of helping someone escape something. Perhaps, it's as simple as helping them escape the dream. They're not erotic, so that doesn't set me on edge. There is an implied connection to the person, but that connection isn't evident to me. I know that I'm a character in the dream, but I don't know who and it feels like I retain myself, while recognizing that I'm a character.

## Running on Whatever

I hate it when 30 things come together all at once.
