Blood pressure last night: 118/84. That's better, but I will still go to the doctor today. Not that Ellen will let me avoid the doctor today.

I found [this](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/?ref=dailydev) today and I want to capture it to improve my *"note-making"* so I can start making better progress. The largest challenge is that I don't live online all the time. I should, but I haven't. 

## Time Series Links

I have found a few new papers that I want to archive and read. I'm going to try to start the habit of documenting them and grabbing the links. Then I can start expanding that into a better brain for the proejct.
