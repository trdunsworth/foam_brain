Waiting to see if I hear from anyone other than Karl about last night's email from Walt. I'm not certain for what he wants to use Salesforce, but it seems fishy to me.

## Other work related things

Karl wants to look at rehosting Starlight once we get finished with the CAD. I can get on board with that.

I built a base survey for the two groups. I can see working with the different groups to get it solidified into a full survey that can be linked to later.

I heard from Ryon. He seems to take my concerns seriously and is supporting my concerns.
