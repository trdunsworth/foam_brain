## In the office

Need to update the Health and Safety report for Tenesia. We hadn't been tracking the outbound calls previously, but she wants them now, so it's not hard to update. Nor is it difficult to update all of 2025 at once.

I updated the H&S numbers for Tenesia.

I think that the eval went well yesterday. I don't think DECC will be happy with finding out that I may be assigned elsewhere for projects from time to time, but that is a good use of my time and skills.

### Follow up next week

I just followed up with Brad about Prepared looking for people with a data science background and he will catch up to me next week. I think I might have surprised him because he understands that I'm looking at exiting the PSAP at that point.
