## Work Notes

### Conversation with Walt

I was pleasantly surprised with the conversation. He gathered the information and was going to investigate it on his side. I think that he will have to discuss part of this with Destiny and remind her that she has to involve me when databases are involved.

I see this as another indicator of some fundamental issues in DECC IT. There is no communication about what's going on or where things stand until they are forced.

The 1130 stand-up was the shyte show that I expected it to be. Neither Walt nor Destiny want to admit that there are still problems in this deployment. Tim called them out on the wine and roses assessment. Walt claims that Destiny is updating someone, but nobody knows who.

## Personal Notes

### GovWorx

I received my invitation to Okta and I have my onboarding appointment. I won't worry about Okta until tonight.
