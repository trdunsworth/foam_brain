## Personal Notes

I really ***HAVE*** to start using this, or any other organizer and notes program much better if it's going to have any positive impact that I want and feel I *need* it to have.

## Work List

1. Get the base report broguht back up to speed
2. Make progress on the survey rewrite
3. Other stuff as assigned

## Home List

1. get the driveway cleared
2. finish up dishes
3. learn if ECSO can do fingerprinting

### For tomorrow

I need to turn the MH calls report into a view that aligns with the response_master_incident view that OPA already can access.
