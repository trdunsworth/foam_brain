## Next Blog Post

I need to grab the link for [Chris'](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7393990348911542272/) and [Lee Ann's](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7398402956141842433/) posts on LinkedIn to start the next blog post.

I need to ensure that I have these moved over so I can grab them for the blog post later. I want to look at how I would build this. 

I also want to see if I can add in other tools that could be used for future work.

List of tools that I'm interested in learning for future reference:

    - marimo notebooks
    - RPweave
    - Lean4
    - Stan
    - Julia
    - "dbt"
    - Altair graphics library

This can get me started. Then I can explore other ideas and updates.

I have to look at my blood pressure. There have been too many readings way too high in the last 18 hours.

### Next steps

This is where I build a project plan as well as the blog post.
