## Work Notes

### GovWorx

Last night was interesting. The meetings left me with a feeling that I am being recruited for my image and reputation as much as anything. I think I can see what they want me to work on for them. It might turn out ok, and I'm going to give it a shot. However, I'm not going to ignore the red flags.

## Personal

### Emacs configs

Going to get the init.el and myinit.org files built out from the Medium tutorials.

Ran the output files through Claude and Gemini and I like the output on these. I think that these will help me build a robust and useful init.el and myinit.org setup.
