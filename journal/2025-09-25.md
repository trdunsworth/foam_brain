Haven't been using this as much as I should. Need to get back into the habit of note taking and documentation of what I'm doing. 

## Reports

I received some good feedback from Gabi yesterday. So, time to digest it and figure out what to do next. Or, more accurately, how to do it.

First comment: Gabi suggested creating additional datasets to analyze E-911 calls vs. Non E-911 calls. I can do that later in the document by creating two new subsets and then performing some analyses on them.
