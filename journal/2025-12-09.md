So many pieces of the puzzle in play today. 

## NENA Notes

### 9-1-1/988 Interchange

Work with Shye to set up a few of the paragraphs for review in tomorrow's meeting.

### Staffing Guidelines

Work on the markdown file with the survey ideas and start sketching out a website that would host this. That way we can show it as a project later.

I've built a prototype, but I can't check it until I place it on a Linux system or get this one to use node better. I will work on the node and npm updates later today.
