So far, *touch wood* everthing has started out quietly. I would like to keep that going for the remainder of the day.

Meetings today have been productive and relatively quick. The meeting with Jason went well. I sort of felt like a lecturing professor. I apologized for it and Jason cracked up saying it was to be expected and he was ok with it because I have specialized in this more than he has. It doesn't mean that I trust him any farther than I can throw him, but it is a start.
