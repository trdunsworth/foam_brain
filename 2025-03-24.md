## Work Notes

### To Do List

-[X] Weekly Reports
-[X] Expungements
-[X] ISD WG Meeting
-[ ] ENP Training
-[X] Karl: Squid Proxy reboot.

I have a meeting with Destiny at 1000 hours to go over a questionnaire. I am not prepared, but she did work to find a spot in my schedule. Apparently, with the new versions of CAD, we will need to implement their common identity management software. We will have to build out new machines to handle that. Thankfully, that won't be so bad and we can integrate it into the rehosting plan as well. Standard VM with SQL Server 2017+ *(So 2022)* 8 GB RAM minimum and C & D drives of 80GB each. Need these for Karl.

We've started lining out how to address the rehost. I think that I have Destiny going in the right direction.

Karl got the server rebooted and Rave detected a heartbeat.

## Personal Notes

Weird dream over night. I was interacting with some professors and they all interacted with each other in English, addressing me in French. I went to an auitorium where one of them was delivering a lecture about what students faced in college and I was thinking that with a central ship-shaped dias, this would be perfect for my "It's About Time" series. Just discovered that Renee and Walt are coming down to the CIPS summit next week. I think this will be fun because they will get to see me speak for the first time. I know that Walt enver saw me speak at NENA National. Now I really get to have some fun with this. I can keep the code base and apply it to the synthetic data that I create for the exercise.

### ISD Working Group meeting

My contribution is running late due to other work that has cropped up. We really didn't come to any decision, but the consensus is that nobody wants to look over everyone's shoulders, nor do they want anyone looking over their shoulders. That's all well and good, but we're not changing anything at this point. 

## Research Notes

Need to follow up on Stochastic Modelling in queues. I ran across [htis textbook](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2968) which covers the topic in tremendous detail. I certainly need to download and avail myself of it for future use in the Staffing WG.

## Presentation

I want to use Quarto to work on this because I think I can make it work quickly and with code and results in the dataset. This could be good. However, I am going to try to use it with revealjs at this point because I don't like the lack of Office support in Quarto. I will figure something out. I typically do. 

I believe that I'm on the right track with this, so here we go.
