# Synthetic_Data_Speech

## Opening Scene

As the demand for data rises and that data needs to be used in different ways, competing concerns about privacy. legality, and bias make the collection and use of data for different pruposes a challenge for data professionals. What if we could create data for different purposes that looks like the data we want, but doesn't contain anything "problematic"? Enter, synthetic data, a way to create usable data for different purposes while addressing the concerns that come with real data. 

### What is synthetic data?

Synthetic data is just that, it's data that is created and designed to look like real data while ensuring that it is all artificial. 

### What are use cases of synthetic data

- machine learning training
- education
- A/B testing

### One Specific Use cases

Because I speak nationally about the use of data analytics in 9-1-1 centres, when I speak I understand that I must protect the privacy of those who access 9-1-1 and the telecommunicators who handle the calls, synthetic data is a great cmopromise that allows me to create and use datasets for my presentations. I can also customise the datasets to emphasize anything I want to show or test, My centre's performance data remains internal and I don't have any *surprises* in the dataset that I might not want to expose.

This also allows me to prevent anyone from recognizing a call that is being discussed in the presentations. Nope, that was not your speeding ticket, nor was it your uncle's cardiac arrest. If the system created a call that looks that close, then seredippity is in play, but that's all it is, an accident.
