## Notes

Colder today, seems like the fire is being challenging.

### Work Notes

Working on the CALEA reports for the Watch Officers and for Myah. I feel like nobody actually looks at the report. They take everything I send and move it along to someone else without really examining what's in the data. *Tony gave us the data, so we know that it's accurate, we don't know what it means or what to do with it, but here it is.* That gets depressing to be honest.

I finished the CALEA reports for Myah. That closes the books on 2024 for me, statistically. I do have the last of the weeklies for 2024 next week, but that bleeds over into 2025, so I really don't stress about that.

I have one of my weekly arguments this week. I feel like I forget how to take notes when we have these.

### Personal Notes

I'm going to start building other snippets in here like [[snippets\test.qmd]] so I can work on things that make sense and be reused in other projects. This just gave me an idea in the recommended text.
