In the city today. That comes with the usual tribulations.

## Staffing Guidelines

- We need to start with focusing on core business.
- Then we can work on the other challenges.
- We have to determine which *additional tasks* take up enough time and labour that they impact the staffing enough to merit inclusion.
- While the California report has over 200 separate tasks, how many of the auxiliary tasks take enough time to impact headcount?
  - If you're doing something 1x/week or 1x/month, unless it takes all day, do you need to account for it?

## Personal

I think that Ellen is right. I am too scattered with my energy and that has led me to wanting to take on more than I can chew for projects. I end up feeling overwhelmed and then I get nothing done from any of the opportunities in front of me. I will review the opportunities and then see where those will lead me. I think that analysing them and determining which are the best use of my time will be beneficial.

I just selected my elective for my Toastmasters Level 4 in Presentation Mastery. I have selected writing a compelling blog. I have to create 8 blog posts in a month. Well, this could help me with what I've written above because I can focus on the things that intersect with tech and 9-1-1. I can also discuss other recent tech topics that I find interesting from my standpoint as a data scientist.
