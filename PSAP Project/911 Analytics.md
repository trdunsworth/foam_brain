# 911 Analytics

I need to grab the link for [Chris'](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7393990348911542272/) and [Lee Ann's](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7398402956141842433/) posts on LinkedIn to start the next blog post.

I want to start with some of Matt Dancho's [open-source work](https://github.com/business-science/ai-data-science-team). Granted, I would prefer to do this in R, but I can convert that over time as I start bringing it around to how I want to create it.

I know that I can do a tonne of this in Python, but I want to keep doing a lot of my work in R where possible and then use [reticulate](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/reticulate-1.pdf). 

I think that DuckDB should be viewed as a way to collect the data and then see what kind of analytics that can be done from it so someone with SQL skills.

I've updated the Excel template for the ECaTS numbers. The trick that Frankie showed me Monday works well. So that is a positive. Because I have a small edge case that creates a divide by zero error, I'm updating the formulae so they can be robust enough to eliminate that error.
