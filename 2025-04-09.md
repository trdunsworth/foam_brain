Destiny did the environmental restart overnight. However, there was no CAB entry and she didn't create a bridge. I arrived late, so she did send a bridge when she noticed that I was poking around looking over her shoulder. Everything seems pretty settled, but the niggling issues have to be monitored. Stepped in around 0330 - stepped out around 0440 so call it 0445.

She has a meeting with Lem about the logs not recording on C2C from 18 FEB to 08 APR. I can see something in the log file that should get Lem's attention. She might invite me to the meeting. Then again, she might not.

I met with Renee. That went well. I like that I can speak frankly to her. Again, she had the standard "there are things moving about, so please hang on." I've hung on so long that the rope is breaking. The Staffing Guidelines meeting went really well this afternoon. I like that we're starting to really make some good progress on discussing what needs to be looked at. However, I have to say, when someone says we're only talking about numbers and there are no people in the document, I think **"Duh! That's the point!"**
