## Personal Notes

Looks like my notes from last night did not get sent up like I thought they did. That happens. I didn't have anything of significance there.
I get to be a spectator today, so that's a positive. Ran into Esmond in the lobby. He and Tenesia are two people that I am glad to see here. Mainly because I like them both a lot. 
Need to pull a card when I get back to the room for lunch. I enjoy being here in this environment. I like beach towns, they are really my vibe. However, I just can't afford to live here. Well, that and the hurricanes aren't fun either.
I also want to start digging into Matt Dancho's stuff a lot more and playing with it to see what it can do. I need to get some of my test data together to play with it and stress it out a bit. I think that I can give him some interesting feedback based on my experiences.
Ellen is frustrated with me because I didn't detail my schedule enough. I can do better with the details. I'm not trying obfuscate what I'm doing. I shouldn't be assuming the level of detail she wants to hear.
