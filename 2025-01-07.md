More winter weather and now Curtis reminds us to expect to telework for the next few days. Trust me, there is no complaint here.

## Work Notes

Downloaded and Installed [Quato](https://quarto.org) and [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/releases) updates today. I will need to install those tonight on my personal computers. I will likely start with the Linux box since I will take it to Florida with me.

## Personal Notes

Noting major so far. I've been pretty quiet, just keeping the home fire burning.
