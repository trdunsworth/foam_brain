Back at work today after being out sick yesterday. I feel better and I was able to get some sleep.

Karl and Destiny both checked in on me. Granted, it felt like Destiny was about to ask for something. I received from good feedback on my newest blog post on my website. That's always a good thing. I also received some great feedback from my talk in Ashland last week. Apparently I was everyone's favourite speaker. That bodes well for my movement and for being invited to speak at more places.
