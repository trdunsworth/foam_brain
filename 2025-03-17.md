## An la Paadrig maith dhuit!

### Work Notes

Today has a good start. I have the stats to take care of and I have some work to do in the ISDWG later today. That should be interesting. I think that this is going to be building a style guide which is something that I can do well.

That meeting went well. However, a different headache arose. We have someone in the Staffing Guidelines group that wanted to tell us how to run the working group to better align with **HIS** expert opinion on where it should go and that we should exert better leadership by telling the group where we're going to work. I don't know how much experience he has in leading working groups, but it certainly doesn't fit with how I have been taught the NENA consensus model. 

Personally, I really don't need to lead this or any other working group. I'm quite content to work as a Data Scientist for NENA groups and be a contributor. I'm always welcome to step aside for experts.

### Personal Notes

I finished my speech about Bob as a mentor. I really like it.
